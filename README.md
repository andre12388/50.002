# 50.002: Computation Structures
This course introduces architecture of digital systems, emphasising structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. 
Topics include Multilevel implementation strategies; definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, and processes) and their mechanisation using lower-level elements. 
Analysis of potential concurrency; precedence constraints and performance measures; pipelined and multidimensional systems; instruction set design issues; architectural support for contemporary software structures.
